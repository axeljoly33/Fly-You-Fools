Do not hesitate to address me the problems you get via Discord (Uganda#4769) or in the comment section.
DISCLAIMER: You have to disable any other Flight mod to make this one working and not buggy.

It is a 1st person flight mod. Click on the row to set-up a keybind. It features:
- 1st person view flight mode.
- User FoV.
- If you don't want to use user FoV while flying, you can set a custom FoV only while flying.
- 6 DoF camera and movement.
- Possibility to change flying speed via mousescroll.
- Automatically detect your keyboard layout. Takes in account: Forward, Backward, Right, Left keys for basic movements. Space and crouch are used for going up and down while in flight.
- Prevent your character from dying to invisible/death walls and hanging to ledges.
- Adjustable and optional UI widget displaying flight informations.
- Minimum, maximum flight speeds and step are adjustables.
- Possibility to hide the UI, your arms and/or your weapon. It is useful if you want to act like a camera for taking photos or making nice videos.
